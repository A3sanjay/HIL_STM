This is the code for the STM32 (F4) part of the HIL project in conjunction with the RPi. 
The objective is for the STM32 to be able to act as a generic HIL board to be able to simulate peripherals on the boards of our University's solar car.
This includes protocol drivers, peripheral logic, and DACs to simulate analog signals.
The work is still in progress, so there should be more to come!
